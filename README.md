This program allows you to use a playstation5 dualsense controller to move your mouse and interact with your pc.

#### compatibility:
It work both on bluetooth and usb mode.

I used this as reference material for the byte-mappings of the controller input/output reports
> [github.com/nondebug/dualsense](https://github.com/nondebug/dualsense)
a copy of the html code is [here](./inspire/README.md) which was a huge help.\
specifically, because I was able to copy some important parts of the JS code and use it with only small modifications to the syntax.
